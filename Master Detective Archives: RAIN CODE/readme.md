If there's no 60fps mod for your region just go here:

- [Asia](https://tinfoil.io/Title/0100F4401940A000)
- [EU](https://tinfoil.io/Title/01004800197F0000)
- [US](https://tinfoil.io/Title/0100149019460000)

Replace the @nsobid numbers + letters on the .pchtxt file with the Build ID's of your region. Grab all numbers + letters until you reach the 0's. In total they are 32 digits. Ex: 2058227F80E9B40C3B51DB95CAF6B206

If Tinfoil doesn't update and doesn't have the latest Build ID: You can extract it using [this method](https://youtu.be/d1XWoEgAgrU) 

You also have a guide about how to port .pchtxt (ExeFS) mods [here](https://github.com/StevensND/ghidra-port-mods-guide) in case you're missing something.
